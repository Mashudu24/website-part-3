#Part 3
-The recent updates to the website-part-3 i focused on improving the site's aesthetics, by modifying the style. CSS file to implement rounded corners on the prominent "Subscribe" button within the navigation bar. This change utilises the CSS border-radius property to transform the previously sharp, rectangular brown box into a curvier, visually softer element, enhancing the overall user interface design. Furthermore, while these changes are purely stylistic, they occur within a web structure that relies on HTML for content, CSS for presentation, and ultimately, JavaScript  for interactive behaviour, such as validating the fields in the subscription form below the navigation bar or handling dynamic page elements. The process for integrating and documenting these code modifications involves using Visual Studio Code's Source Control features to stage the changes, commit them with a descriptive message, and push the final update to the remote GitHub repository.
